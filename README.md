## Getting ready
1. Make sure a 3A fuse tube is properly inserted.

2. Connect the power adapter to the power jack on the board, then turn on the power switch.

3. As soon as the board is powered up, the self-test must be started. The amber LED and 7-segment display will blink at 2Hz during the self-test so you can detect early if any LEDs are dead.

## Fatal Cautions

1. DO NOT connect any outputs to another output. Connecting an output to another one may cause circuit damage, a fire, or an explosion despite a 3A fuse installed.

2. Keep liquid or no-used metal things far away from the board to avoid making a short circuit.
